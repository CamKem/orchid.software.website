Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project! Public bug tracking is an essential part of the open development process. To ensure effective bug reporting, please follow the guidelines below:

## Using the GitHub Issues Tracker

We utilize the public issue tracker, [GitHub Issues Tracker](https://github.com/orchidsoftware/platform/issues), to keep track of current and resolved issues. Before filing a new bug report, it's advisable to search the issue list to check if your report has already been filed. If you find an existing report for your issue, please add a reaction to indicate that you are also affected. Only provide additional information in the comments if it can help identify the source of the issue. Comments like "I have this problem too" or "This is a really important issue" are not necessary.

## Filing a New Issue

If your bug report has not been filed yet, you can proceed to create a new issue. To fill out the "New Issue" page effectively, keep the following points in mind:

### Be Specific in the Summary

The summary of your bug report will serve as the title in the bug tracker. Make sure it is specific to accurately describe the issue. A specific summary helps developers and bug managers easily search for existing reports and avoids duplicate reports. Avoid vague summaries like "App Not Working" or requests like "Increase Performance." Instead, use a summary such as "Notification not sent when process finishes."

### Avoid Subjective or Ambiguous Language

To increase the chances of having your report confirmed, provide objective details rather than using subjective or ambiguous language. Instead of labeling something as "jarring" or "unintuitive," describe what happened and how it contrasts with your expectations. For example, you can say "The Toast suddenly appeared instead of being animated in," which provides actionable and objective information about the problem.

### Be Concise, But Explain the Issue

Bug reports should be written in English, with attention to language and grammar. It is crucial to provide enough information for the developer to reproduce the issue. Include clear and numbered steps to reproduce the bug if necessary.

Remember, bug reports aim to gather users facing similar problems to work together towards a solution. While your report may lead to collaboration, do not expect others to solely fix your problem. Use the bug report as a starting point for joint problem-solving efforts.

### Be Prepared to Provide More Information

Insufficient information in your report may result in it being marked as "Incomplete." Developers might request specific additional details through comments. Failing to provide the requested information may lead to your report being closed.

If you accidentally report your issue against the wrong app, it may be marked as "Invalid." If the correct app is known, a developer may ask you to re-file the report accordingly. Otherwise, you should find the correct app and re-file the report yourself.

For "Wishlist" issues like feature requests, the developer may mark it as "Opinion" or "Won't Fix." Remember that developers are often open to discussing these topics, but it is essential to respect their decision and not harass them for marking your report in this way.

Thank you for contributing to the project! Your bug reports are invaluable in making our software better for everyone.
