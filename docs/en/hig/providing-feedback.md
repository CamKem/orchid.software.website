## Toasts


User notifications typically consist of one or two simple sentences and do not require a header. Often, people add unnecessary headlines such as "Dear users," "Important announcement," "Attention!" or "Convincing request!" However, using such headlines may indicate that the content is irrelevant to users.

To make the most of the user's attention, it's important to avoid extraneous information and get straight to the point.
