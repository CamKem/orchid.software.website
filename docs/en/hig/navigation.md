## Hidden vs Disabled

Hiding an unavailable action entirely is often preferable to a disabled button, as this reduces UI clutter. However, in certain situations this can be problematic:

- If the user expects a button to be present, such as at the end of a form, hiding the button can cause confusion, even if the form clearly indicates the presence of one or more invalid fields.
- As a hidden button doesnâ€™t occupy any space in the UI, toggling its visibility can cause unwanted changes in the layout of other elements.
