Text is an interface element, like a button or an input box. It helps solve an interface problem: it explains what you don't understand and convinces you to perform the desired action.

The user has no time, he is in the flow of solving his task. So he skips long and complex chunks of text. For the user to read the text, use the necessary minimum of words.


## Naming Screen

Screen names are a vital and essential part of the user experience. 
Not only do they play an important practical role in communicating what an app does, but they also establish app identity and character.

A good screen name should:

- Consist of one or two simple nouns.
- Be related to the appâ€™s domain (for example: Source for a links news)
- Be short (less than 15 characters).
- Be easy to pronounce.
- Be easily paired with a good app icon, such as by referencing a physical object.
- Use header capitalization (for example: Icon Preview instead of Icon preview).

Likewise, a good name should avoid:

- Overly complicated names and/or acronyms.
- Puns and inside jokes.
- Non-standard punctuation or whitespace (for example: SuperWriter).
- Made-up words or word combinations.

## Naming Menu Items

Menu items should have names that are either actions or locations, never descriptions. Make sure menu items are concise, but also fully describe the action that will be performed when they are clicked.

"Settings" is acceptable as it clearly describes the action that will be performed when the item is clicked.
"Software Up to Date" is not acceptable. What happens if I click this item? Where will it take me? What will it do? The outcome is uncertain.
