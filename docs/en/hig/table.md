Designing an effective table can be challenging, especially when dealing with a large number of columns or limited space. Let's take a list of products as an example and explore some best practices for table design.

- Simplify the columns: Before attempting to resize the table, consider merging columns that are not necessary. For instance, the image and unique identifier columns can be combined to create more space.
- Merge similar information: In the same example, the name and description columns can be merged to provide more information in a smaller space.
- Use filters for complex information: The category column can show the final value, but the whole chain of categories can be specified in filters instead.
- Emphasize important information: The status of the product is important information that should be easily noticeable. Adding an icon that accurately represents the status and highlighting it in gray if the item is missing will improve the visual component of the table.
- Format prices: Proper formatting of prices will improve the overall readability of the table.
- Determine optimal column width: Determine the optimal width for each column to create a visually balanced table.

By following these steps, a cluttered table with cramped elements can be transformed into a clear and visually appealing display.
