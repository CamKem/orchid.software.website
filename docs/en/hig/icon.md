Icons can make our interfaces clearer, cleaner, and more enjoyable without taking up too much screen space.
However, there's a delicate balance between enhancing the user experience and overwhelming the user with too many icons. 
It's important to use icons thoughtfully and make them accessible, rather than simply relying on them as a space-saving shortcut.


## Icons Need a Text Label

Only a few icons are universally recognized by users, like the home, print, and magnifying glass icons for search. Most icons, however, are ambiguous because they mean different things on different interfaces. This inconsistency makes it hard for users to rely on an icon's functionality, which can affect its adoption over time.

Icons such as the heart and the star often represent favorites, bookmarks, featured items, and ratings from other users, but their precise meaning varies between applications. These icons can also compete with each other, adding to the confusion. As a result, it's hard for users to remember their meanings accurately.

To overcome this ambiguity, it's best to include a text label alongside an icon to clarify its meaning in a particular context. Even if you use a standard icon, it's still a good idea to include a label, especially if you've modified the icon's appearance. It's important to make sure that the label is always visible without requiring any interaction from the user. For navigation icons, labels are particularly important, so don't rely on hover to reveal text labels as this can increase the interaction cost and doesn't work well on touch devices.
